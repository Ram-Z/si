# SI

A small C++17 header-only library for strongly typed units.

## How to use it
Simply install the header file into your projects include path.

## Dependencies
This library depends only on the standard C++ library. It is currently targeted 
at C++17, but a C++14 implementation might be considered in the future.

The unit-tests require [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch).
